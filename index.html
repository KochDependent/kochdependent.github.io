                        <b><i>Meghan: </i></b>"We've actually known each other since we were young but we didn’t actually speak to one another until we were adults.
                        We've been swimming together since we were 8 years old but it wasn't until after college that we crossed paths at a mutual friend’s birthday
                        party. I saw him and thought to myself that he grew up nice and decided to go over and start a conversation, the rest is history."

                    <p align="left">

                        She had been admiring me from afar for years no matter what she says. But in reality we keep coming across all these situations where we were
                        literally right next to each other and just shaking our heads at how not even once did we talk to each other growing up. Weird how these things
                        work out, but at least it worked out in the end!"

                    <p align="left">
                        <b><i>Meghan: </i></b>Well.......we met at a friend’s birthday party and I impressed him over my craft beer knowledge and then we wound up
                        talking all night. The better story actually is that a few days after this party I came back up to Cleveland to celebrate New Years with some
                        friends and Mike happened to be celebrating New Years at the same place. We had been texting prior to this and planned to meet up that night.
                        He actually ended up being my New Years Kiss! Mike went to get a drink and while he was gone the clock started to count down and he was no
                        where to be found and with just seconds to go he comes up behind me and says, 'you didn't think I would miss this did you?' and then we kissed
                        right at midnight. It was very magical and made for a great story!"
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        <b><i>Mike: </i></b>"She barged into my apartment like she owned the place and hasn't left me alone since. In slightly more seriousness, we kept
                        making eye contact across the party in my apartment and, no matter what she says, I moved to approach her first. We got some of the awkward
                        'I kinda know you…' conversations out of the way and ended up just chatting the whole night. I found some silly excuse to talk to her after she
                        went back to St. Louis and we haven't stopped since. She came back for New Year's and I carefully planned out our last-second New Year's kiss…
                        Ok fine, I went to the bathroom and only just made it back in time."

                    <h3>How did Mike propose?</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                        <b><i>Meghan: </i></b>"We were in Boston for the weekend visiting Boston College for Mike's admitted student day for law school. We went to
                        dinner at this nice place and when we first sat down at our table our server poured us a glass of champagne. I immediately started getting
                        suspicious, but Mike assured me that he had no idea what was going on. Then they brought out a side of mac and cheese with a carrot on top
                        (1. mac and cheese is my favorite food and 2. the carrot is from and inside joke). At that point I asked Mike what was going on but he
                        re-directed the conversation away from the topic. We then had dessert and left the restaurant!!! He didn't propose there so at this point
                        I was really confused. We then went back to the hotel and there was a bottle of champagne and a tray of chocolate covered strawberries waiting
                        for us. I knew right at that point what was going on and started to tear up. Mike poured us a glass of champagne and took me out onto the
                        balcony which had an amazing view of the Boston skyline. At this point, the skyline was all lit up at night. Mike then started to tell me
                        how much he loved me and got down on one knee. At this point I was crying and of course said yes!"
                    </p>
                    <p align="left">
                        <b><i>Mike: </i></b>"I worked on this for a while. When it became clear that there was literally no one else in the world I would ever want
                        to be with I started shopping for rings. Ask Meghan, she only gave me minimal guidance. I have to brag a little because I think I did a
                        damned good job finding a flower ring for a modern flower-child. But anyways, I asked her parents and her grandparents while I was in
                        Sandusky one weekend and was sweating BULLETS. We had small talk for what felt like 10 years and then I got to say my piece and show
                        everyone the ring. I planned the whole trip to Boston and thought up a couple clever lies (Sorry, Bug… But it was worth it) about how we
                        should at least spend one night in town and how this restaurant just must really take care of its guests, so on and so forth. She was suspicious
                        the whole time. I disappeared from our room 3 times to go talk to the front desk about the room, dessert, and champagne and to call the restaurant
                        and confirm the details. You really should've seen her at dinner, she was on edge the whole time in the best possible way. All smiles every
                        time something "unexpected" happened. When we got back to the room she completely ignored the champagne and dessert. I mean walked right by it.
                        I could've dropped dead until I loudly cleared my throat and she caught on. All-in-all, the night went perfectly. In a weird way it totally renewed
                        my faith in humanity because, as much as I thought I had planned, I got a TON of help from the people I talked to, and without even asking.
                        I owe a lot to our front desk guy and the waiter for helping to really make the night perfect. But I will NEVER forget the look on Meghan's face
                        when she finally realized what was happening."
